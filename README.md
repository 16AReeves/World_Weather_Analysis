## Module 6: Analysis on Weather Data to Predict Vacation Spots using Python APIs
---
### Purpose
---
#### The purpose of this repository is to upload the files and images from the World Weather Analysis Module. The files attached are jupyter notebooks that contain weather data based on randomly generated latitude and longitude. After creating the weather data and looking at how different aspects may affect an area, such as cloudiness, humidity, max temperature, and wind speed, google cloud api services was used to find random vacation spots. These vacation spots were pulled using googles api services, and then the data was analyzed for a random vacation spot, a good hotel in the area, and directions for four cities in California. 
---
### Future Use
---
#### This code can be refactored in the future to analyze the best time of the year to go to certain vacation spots based on historical weather data. This code can be used to get directions to different cities without refactoring.
